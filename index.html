      <strong>explainer</strong>
    </p>
    <p>This is an experiemnt to implement structured (
      <a href="http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html">Paredit</a>-like) code editing and navigation for JavaScript and other languages where source code is represented as
      plain text (no explicit structure). Source code of a program is inherently a tree of its syntax tokens, but most programming
      languages represent its syntax tree as plain text. Instead sometimes it is useful to operate on syntax nodes, instead
      of characters and words.</p>

      <strong>give it a try</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of this demo is to gather feedback for future development and editors integration. Please give it a try and
      report any issues or suggestion to
      <a href="https://github.com/roman01la/structed/issues">GitHub repository</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Paste some code into the editor below and try to refactor it as usual, but also use provided editor commands where you
      would usually go with manual selection or navigation (mouse, arrow keys + alt).</p>
